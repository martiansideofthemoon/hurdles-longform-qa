# Hurdles to Progress in Long-form Question Answering

This repository (in-progress) will contain the official scripts and datasets accompanying our NAACL 2021 paper, "[Hurdles to Progress in Long-form Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06332)". We hope to eventually open-source our c-REALM retriever and Routing Transformer generative model as well.
